Summary:
-> Files are opened with open()
-> Specify encodings for text-mode files
-> Text-mode works with str and does universal newline translation and encoding
-> Binary-mode works with bytes objects
-> Callers are responsible for providing newlines
-> Files have line-reading support and yield lines on iteration
-> Files are context managers which close files on exit
-> The notion of file-like object is loosely defined by very useful
-> Context managers aren't restricted to file-like objects
-> help() can called on objects, not just types
-> Python supports the bitwise operators &, |, <<, and >>
