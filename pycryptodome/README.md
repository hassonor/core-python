# Cryptography with PyCryptodome

Practical cryptography examples using the [PyCryptodome](https://www.pycryptodome.org/) library.

## Topics

- **[RSA](rsa/)** — RSA key generation, public-key encryption, and decryption
- **[AES-CBC](aes/cbc/)** — AES encryption in Cipher Block Chaining mode
- **[AES-EAX](aes/eax/)** — AES authenticated encryption with EAX mode
- **[Hybrid RSA + AES](aes_rsa/)** — Combining asymmetric (RSA) and symmetric (AES) encryption
- **[End-to-End Encryption](e2e_rsa_aes_eax/)** — Full E2E encrypted client-server communication using RSA + AES-EAX

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```
