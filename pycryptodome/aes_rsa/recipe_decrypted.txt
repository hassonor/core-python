Sender:
1. Get file to encrypt/send
2. Create a random AES symmetric key
3. Get the recipients public RSA key
4. Encrypt the AES key with pub key (RSA asymmetric)
5. Use AES key to encrypt file (AES symmetric)
6. Write both encrypted AES key and encrypted file to one bundled file (Not Must)
7. Send bundled file to recipient

Recipient:
1. Read first 16 bytes of bundled file (get RSA encrypted AES key)
2. Read next 16 bytes and get IV
3. Decrypt AES key with private RSA key
4. Use AES key to decrypt rest of bundled file
6. Open file
