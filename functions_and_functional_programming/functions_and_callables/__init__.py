Functions Types:
-> Free functions: Function defined at module scope.
-> Methods: Functions defined within a class definition.

Argument Types:
-> Positional arguments: are matched with formal arguments by position, in order
-> Keyword arguments: are matched with formal arguments by name
*** The choice between the two is made at the call site

Default Arguments:
-> Arguments may have a *default value*
-> The default value for an argument is *only evaluated once*
-> Be careful when using *mutable data types* for default values

"""
Class objects and instances of classes
are very different things.
class binds a class object to a named reference.

"""
Classes Are Object Factories
-> Classes *produce new instances* when they are invoked.

"""
Alternative to Class:
-> cls: Shortened version "class" --> Very common in the Python ecosystem
-> klass: Deliberate misspelling of "class" --> A bit more explicit

"""
Rules for *args
-> Must come after normal positional arguments
-> Only collection positional arguments
