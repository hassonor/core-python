reasonable assertion?<br>
**A:** The value 3 is the average value of the data set.

**Q:** You grade exams for your class, and the grades are {70,73,75,78,81,85,87,92,99,100}. How do you determine the
mode of this set, and what is its value?<br>
**A:** The mode is the most frequently occurring value, and this data set has no mode.

**Q:** You have a basic sorted data set of {54,70,70,80,85,98,99,100,102}. What is the value 70 in this data set?<br>
**A:** the mode

### Variability

___

#### Range

* Largest data point - Smallest data point
    * E.g: `Data Set 1`: [45,68,51,65,57,50,55,95,48,51] -> Range: 95(Max) - 45(Min) = 50
    * E.g: `Data Set 2`: [5,0,75,80,97,42,39,38,150,64] -> Range: 150(Max) - 0(Min) = 150

#### Standard deviation

* `Data Set`: [95,105,112,116,133,148,155,156,231]
    * `Mean`: 139
    * `Median`: 133
    * `Standard deviation`: 41
* `Z-Score`: A data point's distance, in standard deviations, from the mean

```math
z-score = \frac{(xi - x_{mean})}{s}
- \( xi \) = data point
- \( x_{mean} \) = mean
- \( s \) = standard deviation
```

#### Calculating standard deviation (סטיית תקן)

The standard deviation, often represented as \( \sigma \), is calculated using the following formula:

```math
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}
```

#### Empirical Rule

Most of the data points in a given data set fall within three standard deviations of the mean.

#### Outliers

A data point that is an abnormal distance from the other values in the data set

* `Factors to Consider`:
    * Knowledge
    * Training
    * Equipment
* `Questions to Ask`:
    * Is this really an outlier?
    * How did this happen?
    * What can we learn?

**Q:** How do you calculate the standard deviation of a sample data set?
**A:** Sum the distance of each element of the set from the mean, divide this value by the number of elements minus 1,
and take the square root.<br>

**Q:** How should you determine whether a data point is an outlier or not?
**A:** There is no standard definition to identify an outlier.<br>

**Q:** What are statisticians describing when they use range and standard deviation?
**A:** the variability of data set<br>

**Q:** In a national standardized test the mean score was 575 out of 800. The standard deviation was 75 points. So a
student that scored a perfect score of 800 was _____.
**A:** We need to calculate the Z-score: X is the score of interest (in our case, 800), mean is 575 and the standard
deviation is 75. So our z-score = (800-575)/ 75 = 3. So the answer is 3. <br>

**Q:** Two sets of temperature data are identical, except one is in °C and the other is in °F. The standard deviations
are 20°C for set 1 and 68°F for set 2. Which set has the greater variability?
**A:** Both sets have the same variability.<br>

**Q:** According to the empirical rule, how many standard deviations contain 99.7% of the data for a normal
distribution?
**A:** mean - 3SD and mean + 3SD. three.<br>

**Q:** A certain data set has a standard deviation of 20 and a mean of 150. One of the values in the data set is 120,
what is the Z-score for this data point?
**A:** (120 - 150 / 20) = -1.5<br>

**Q:** How should you calculate the z-score of a data set value?
**A:** Subtract the mean from the value and divide this quantity by the standard deviation.<br>

**Q:** Which statement is TRUE?
**A:** An outlier is a data point an abnormal distance from the other values. But there is not an exact definition of
abnormal.<br>

**Q:** Find the range for this data set with five values. 25,60,95,175,195
**A:** 195 - 25 = 170<br>

**Q:** How should you calculate the range of a data set?
**A:** Subtract the smallest value in the set from the largest value.<br>

**Q:** In a national standardized test the mean score was 300 out of 500. The standard deviation was 50 points.
According
to the empirical rule, we would expect 95% of all scores to be between _____.
**A:**  mean - 2SD and mean + 2SD. 200 and 400<br>
